Based on the provided project information and requirements, here is a CI configuration in YAML format using GitHub Actions. This configuration supports the specified requirements for building, linting, and testing a Java-based Spring Boot microservices application:


# FILENAME: .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-test-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30

    steps:
    # Checkout the source code
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Setup Java environment
    - name: Setup Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    # Cache Gradle dependencies
    - name: Cache Gradle dependencies
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: |
          ~/.gradle/caches
          ~/.gradle/wrapper
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}

    # Configure Checkstyle (if not already configured)
    - name: Configure Checkstyle
      run: |
        mkdir -p config/checkstyle
        curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml > config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml
      if: !exists(config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml)

    # Linting stage
    - name: Run Linter
      run: ./gradlew checkstyleMain
      # Quality gate: The pipeline will fail if there are style violations

    # Build stage
    - name: Build project
      run: ./gradlew :server:bootJar --no-daemon
      # Quality gate: The pipeline will fail if there are build errors

    # Test stage
    - name: Run tests
      run: ./gradlew test
      # Quality gate: The pipeline will fail if there are test failures

    # Docker build (optional, run only if needed)
    - name: Build Docker Image
      run: docker build -t my-service:latest .
      env:
        SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: "dev"
        DATABASE_URL: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"
        GRPC_PORT: "9090"

    # Upload artifacts (if needed)
    - name: Upload JAR and Docker Image
      if: success()
      run: |
        docker save my-service:latest | gzip > my-service-latest.tar.gz
        echo "Artifacts prepared for deployment"


### Key Points:
- **Java Version**: Java 17 is set up using `actions/setup-java`.
- **Gradle Caching**: Utilizes `actions/cache` to cache Gradle dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.
- **Linting**: Uses Checkstyle for Java code linting. A check for `checkstyle.xml` configuration is included to auto-configure if missing.
- **Building and Testing**: Gradle is used to build and test the project with commands derived from project metadata.
- **Docker**: Provides an optional stage to build a Docker image if necessary. Environment variables can be set as required by the application.
- **Timeout and Quality Gates**: The workflow includes timeout protection and quality gates to fail the pipeline on lint, build, or test failures.
- **YAML Comments**: Comments are added to provide a clear picture of what each section is doing in the workflow.

Ensure that any Docker-related operations (like connecting to a Docker registry) have the necessary credentials and permissions configured as secrets in your GitHub repository.
